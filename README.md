# Data Description

## Given a unique opportunity to work with and analyze data about video game players and the extent of their participation in the game "PlaiCraft", we aim to analyze the data to refine recruitment efforts of players while improving quality of players' gameplay. We are presented with data consisting of many variables such as a player's age, name, gender, experience as a gamer (ranging from Amateur to Veteran), the number of hours spent playing the game, as well as the number of different sessions a player has spent playing Plaicraft with the respective start and end times. We are also given information about whether the player is a subscriber to the game, and the email associated with their user. The number of hours represents the extent of their gameplay, and is crucial to analyze in order to determine whether this variable may correlate to the skill level the gamers possess. Does skill level have a positive relationship with the number of hours spent playing and if so, is it strong? Additionally, does any given skill level correlate to collectively more hours spent on the game for that level of skill? This is important information to gain insight into whether recruitment efforts should be made towards Amateurs or Veterans, for example.
