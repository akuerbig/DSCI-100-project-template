# Data Description

## Given a unique opportunity to work with and analyze data about video game players and the extent of their participation in the game "PlaiCraft", we aim to analyze the data to refine recruitment efforts of players while improving quality of players' gameplay. We are presented with data consisting of many variables such as players' ages, names, experience as a gamer (ranging from Amateur to Veteran), as well as number of hours spent playing the game. The number of hours represents the extent of their gameplay, and is crucial to analyze in order to determine whether this variable may correlate to the skill level the gamers possess. Does skill level have a positive relationship with the number of hours spent playing and if so, is it strong? This is important information to gain insight into whether a player is more likely to continue playing based on increasing skill level.
